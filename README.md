# Dataset Cleaning and Validation

## Overview
This repository contains a dataset cleaning and validation script to ensure data integrity before analysis. The script performs checks for missing values, outliers, and correct data types. After processing, the cleaned dataset is saved as a `.csv` file for further analysis.

## Steps Performed

1. **Load Dataset**  
   - Load the dataset from the specified source.
   
2. **Missing Value Handling**  
   - Identify missing values in the dataset.  
   - Apply an appropriate strategy to handle missing data based on its nature (e.g., imputation or removal).
